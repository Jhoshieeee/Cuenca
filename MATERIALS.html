			<h2>PAINTBRUSH</h2>
			<ul>
				<h3>TRADITIONAL PAINTBRUSH</h3><br>
				<img src="watercolor paintbrush.jpg">
				<p>This paintbrush typically used in a casual setting. It is basically used indoors, as it needs
				a container of water,<br> your watercolor pallette, and your watercolor paper. This type of brush is your typical
				paintbrush<br> that absorbs a lot of water and ables you to mix it with the watercolor pigment.</p>
				<br><br><br><br><br>
				
				<h3>WATERBRUSH</h3>
				<img src="waterbrush.jpg">
				<p>This type of paintbrush is made for convenience as it stores water inside a conatiner.<br> When the 
				waterbrush is squeezed, droplets of water will come out and used to be mixed with the pigment.<br> This
				type of brush are usually used outdoors when doing outdoor painting, but can also be used in indoors.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>WATERCOLOR PAINT</h2>
			<ul>
				<h3>WATERCOLOR TUBES</h3><br>
				<img src="watercolor tubes.jpg">
				<p>Watercolor pigments are stored in a foil tube wherein the paint is in liquid form.<br> This type of 
				paint is much easier to mix compared to a watercolor palette. Although, it is required<br> to have its own
				palette where you have to mix the pigments.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
				
				<h3>WATERCOLOR PALETTE</h3><br>
				<img src="watercolor palette.jpg">
				<p>Watercolor pigments are stored in a single palette called a "pan". Watercolor palettes are usually<br>
				in a form of a case, where the pans are stored, a built-in palette where you mix the pigments, and
				a sponge<br> where you wipe of excess pigments or water in the brush.</p>
				<br><br><br><br><br>
				
				<h3>WATERCOLOR INK</h3><br>
				<img src="watercolor ink.jpg">
				<p>This type of watercolor paint are made out of "dye" rather than "pigments". This type of paint are<br> the
				most expensive. When using this type of paint, the color is permanent in the painting, and cannot be erased.
				Most professionals use this type of paint as it has distinct properties in the painting such as<br> saturated 
				colors, vibrant hues and non-grainy texture.</p><br><br>
				
				<h3>GOUACHE</h3><br>
				<img src="gouache.jpg">
				<p>This type of paint is a combination of acrylic and watercolor. Its properties when used alone is very<br> opaque just
				like an acrylic, however, when mixed with water, it acts like a watercolor paint, making it transparent<br> and less saturated.
				Gouache can be stored in both palette and tubes, and has the consistency<br> of poster or acrylic paint.</p>
				<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
			</ul>
			<h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
			<ul>
				<h3>TISSUE PAPER</h3>
				<img src="tissue.png">
				<p>You need tissue paper to wipe off excess pigment, or absorb excess water in your paintbrush.
				Tissue paper<br> are also used to erase or wipe off unnecessary pigment in the painting, which a technique
				called "lifting".</p><br><br><br><br><br>
				
				<h3>WATER</h3>
				<img src="water.jpg">
				<p>Water is the essential material used in watercolor painting. It activates the pigment in the watercolor paint,<br>
				then it is applied to the canvas. The water shall be dried in order to move to the next layer. A water conatiner is
				also<br> essential to rinse of excess pigment in the brush. It is recommended to have 2 containers of water,<br> one for 
				mixing, and one for rinsing.</p><br><br>
				
				<h3>WATERCOLOR PAPER</h3>
				<img src="watercolor paper.jpg">
				<p>This is your canvas. A good watercolor paper should be thick enough for it to absorb much water without ripping or tearing.
				A watercolor paper is varied in its thickness by grams per square meter (gsm). A good watercolor paper is recommended around
				200 gsm up to 300 gsm. Lower or greater than that affects the quality of your painting.</p><br><br><br><br><br>
				
				<h3>TECHNICAL PEN</h3>
				<img src="technical pen.jpg">
				<p>Technical pens are very helpful when doing a watercolor painting that requiers a line-art. Technical pens<br> are used to
				draw lines and figures, as its ink is waterproof, therefore not being affected when water is applied.</p>
